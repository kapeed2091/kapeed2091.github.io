I try to address the "problem I face" with technology. 

I believe in the philosophy - "Change is the only thing thats constant". I love to build systems which are flexible and can easily scale.

In the current role at iB Hubs, I am responsible of the entire backend (server-side) for the projects we undertake. I communicate with other stakeholders and see what best fits in for a particular application with available resources in hand and design/implement accordingly. I also ensure that the effort we put is reusable and plan things accordingly. 

In my previous stint at Veda Semantics, I primarily worked on Machine Learning and Data Science (to an extent). I built basic frameworks for Topic-Theme Identification and Intent Analysis.

I am an avid reader of tech blogs and follow current trends in tech domain. I also love reading books (mostly related to personal management/fiction) and travelling on bike (my last expedition was to Leh-Ladakh).

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
